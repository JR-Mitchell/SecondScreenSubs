# SecondScreenSubs
Exceedingly simple local webpage for displaying subtitles in large on a second screen

To run:

 - Have your computer attached to multiple screens
 - Prepare to watch the movie or show on the first screen
 - On your second screen, open `main.html` in a modern browser
 - Click the file browsing button that appears and select the `.srt` file with the subtitles for whatever you are watching
 - Once loaded in, a five second countdown will begin. Start the movie at the moment the countdown hits '0'.
